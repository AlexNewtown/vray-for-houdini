# UI Guideline

## Formatting

* Spaces only
* Indent with 4 spaces

## Naming

* All labels "Title Case Only"
* No dashes in names (allowed only where needed like "F-Number")
* Abbrevations are in UPPERCASE (e.g. "SSS")
* Don't shorten labels if they are fitting in GUI. Use shorten names only where needed or very common (like "Subdivs" is fine)

## Grouping

* Prefer folder to avoid much scrolling
* Don't use group titles in labels. If you are grouping attributes under "Refraction" group just use "Color" as the refraction_color label.
